## Installation

### npm

Installing with npm is recommended and it works seamlessly with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```shell
npm install canknow-ui -S
```

### CDN

Get the latest version from [unpkg.com/canknow-ui](https://unpkg.com/canknow-ui/) , and import JavaScript and CSS file in your page.

:::tip
We recommend our users to lock canknow-ui's version when using CDN. Please refer to [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) for more information.
